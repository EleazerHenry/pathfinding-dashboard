# 🧭 Pathfinding Algorithm Dashboard

A powerful and interactive Streamlit web app for visualizing and benchmarking pathfinding algorithms (A*, Dijkstra, Greedy, BFS, and DFS) on grid maps.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Upload custom `.txt` maps (grids)
- ✅ Optional `.json` for start/goal positions
- 📊 Real-time performance comparison (Nodes, Path Length, Cost)
- 🕸 Live radar chart visualization
- 📥 Export results to Excel or PDF
- 🔁 Automatically runs A*, Dijkstra, Greedy, BFS, DFS on upload

---

## 📂 File Formats

### 1. `grid.txt` (Map File)
Each line = a row in the grid.
- `0` = walkable
- `1` = obstacle
